A daemon for Kubernetes to kill target resources under user-defined templated conditions

## Motivation

In today's fast-paced environments, Kubernetes clusters often manage systems that dynamically create and destroy resources automatically. Examples of these are pipelines and cronjobs.

However, these automated processes can sometimes get stuck, causing disruptions that affect the smooth operation of the entire system. Often, simply terminating some of these objects can restore normalcy.

There is a need for a solution that empowers Kubernetes administrators to automate this cleanup process efficiently.
This project exists to provide a robust agent for automating the deletion of potential stuck resources,
ensuring your Kubernetes clusters run smoothly and reliably.

## Flags

As every configuration parameter can be defined in the config file, there are only few flags that can be defined.
They are described in the following table:

| Name              | Description                    |    Default    | Example                  |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------:|:-------------------------|
| `--config`        | Path to the YAML config file   | `hitman.yaml` | `--config ./hitman.yaml` |
| `--log-level`     | Verbosity level for logs       |    `info`     | `--log-level info`       |
| `--disable-trace` | Disable showing traces in logs |   `false`     | `--disable-trace`        |

> Output is thrown always in JSON as it is more suitable for automations

```console
hitman run \
    --log-level=info
    --config="./hitman.yaml"
```

## Examples

Here you have a complete example. More up-to-date one will always be maintained in
`docs/prototypes` directory [here](./docs/prototypes)


```yaml
version: v1alpha1
kind: Hitman
metadata:
  name: killing-sample
spec:
  synchronization:
    time: 1m
    processingDelay: 1s
  resources:

    - target:
        group: ""
        version: v1
        resource: pods

        # Select the resources by their name
        # Choose one of the following options
        name:
          matchRegex: ^(coredns-)
          #matchExact: "coredns-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy"

        # Select the namespace where the resources are located
        # Choose one of the following options
        namespace:
          matchRegex: ^(kube-system)
          #matchExact: kube-system

      conditions:

      # Delete the resources when they are older than 10 minutes
      - key: |-
          {{/* Define some variables */}}
          {{- $maxAgeMinutes := 10 -}}

          {{- $nowTimestamp := (now | unixEpoch) -}}
          {{- $podStartTime := (toDate "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00" .object.status.startTime) | unixEpoch -}}

          {{/* Calculate the age of the resource in minutes */}}
          {{- $minutedFromNow := int (round (div (sub $nowTimestamp $podStartTime) 60) 0) -}}

          {{/* Print true ONLY if the resource is older than 5 minutes */}}
          {{- printf "%v" (ge $minutedFromNow $maxAgeMinutes) -}}
        value: true
```

As you probably noticed in the previous example, conditions are made using vitamin Golang template
(better known as Helm template), so **all the functions available in Helm are available here too.**
This way you start creating wonderful deletions from first minute.

**Sometimes it's needed to process the whole list of targets before being evaluated for deletion.** This is useful to
analyze the resources deeper, and group or drop some of them based on user-defined desires.

Because of that, there is a special optional `preStep` section that is evaluated just one time before evaluating conditions.
In that section an object `.targets` is injected.

It's also possible to store custom content into variables that will be alive during the whole evaluation lifecycle, so stored content
will be available inside conditions templates into `.vars` object.

To store content, there is a function called `setVar`. It can be used as follows:

```yaml
version: v1alpha1
kind: Hitman
metadata:
  name: killing-sample
spec:
  resources:

    - ...

      # (Optional) Define a preStep
      preStep: |
        {{/* The whole list of targets is available */}}
        {{ $retrievedTargets := .targets }}


        {{/* Let's define example data */}}
        {{- $someDataForLater := dict "name" "example-name" "namespace" "example-namespace" -}}


        {{/* Store your data under your desired key. You can use as many keys as needed */}}
        {{- setVar "example" $someDataForLater -}}

      conditions:

      # Delete the resources when they are older than 10 minutes
      - key: |-
          {{/* Retrieve a previously defined variable if needed */}}
          {{ $myStoredKey := .vars.example }}

          {{/* Add some logic here to evaluate your conditions */}}
        value: true
```

> [!TIP]
> Another useful function that can be used in templates is `logPrintf`. It accepts the same params as printf
> but throw the result in controller's logs instead of returning it

## How to deploy

This project is designed specially for Kubernetes, but also provides binary files
and Docker images to make it easy to be deployed however wanted

### Binaries

Binary files for most popular platforms will be added to the [releases](https://github.com/achetronic/hitman/releases)

### Kubernetes

You can deploy `hitman` in Kubernetes using Helm as follows:

```console
helm repo add hitman https://achetronic.github.io/hitman/

helm upgrade --install --wait hitman \
  --namespace hitman \
  --create-namespace achetronic/hitman
```

> More information and Helm packages [here](https://achetronic.github.io/hitman/)


### Docker

Docker images can be found in GitHub's [packages](https://github.com/achetronic/hitman/pkgs/container/hitman)

> Do you need it in a different container registry? I think this is not needed, but if I'm wrong, please, let's discuss
> it in the best place for that: an issue
