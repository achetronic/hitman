Congratulations! You have successfully deployed Hitman with a basic default configuration.

IMPORTANT:
- This deployment is using a basic default configuration (`hitman.yaml`) to prevent runtime errors during installation.
- It is highly recommended to customize the configuration to suit your needs.

To update the configuration, follow these steps:

1. Edit the existing ConfigMap:

   kubectl edit configmap hitman.yaml -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

   Add your custom configuration values following the documentation.

2. Alternatively, you can update the values using Helm:

   helm upgrade {{ .Release.Name }} ./path-to-your-chart -f custom-values.yaml

   In your custom `custom-values.yaml`, specify your desired configuration.
